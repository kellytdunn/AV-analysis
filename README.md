Cluster analysis of Puget Sound residents' attitudes about autonomous vehicles

This analysis uses survey data from the Puget Sound Regional Council's [2019 Household Travel Survey](https://psrc.org/household-travel-survey-program) about attitudes towards autonomous vehicles. 

My data are comprised of ten questions assessing survey respondents' interest in and concern about AVs. These include questions like:
- How interested are you in riding in an autonomous taxi, with no driver present?
- How interested are you in riding in an autonomous taxi, with a backup driver present?
- How concerned are you about the equipment and safety of AVs?
- How concerned are you about the performance of AVs in poor weather?

I perform a hierarchical cluster analysis (unsupervised) to identify groups of respondents with similar attitude towards autonomous vehicles. 
Data and a data dictionary can be downloaded from the link above.
